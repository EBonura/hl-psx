//! The game's one [`Gpu`] driver.
//!
//! Immediate drawing, the display flip, and the kicks of the frame's ordering
//! tables all reach GP0, GP1 or channel 2 from places that share no frame-loop
//! state: the deferred overlay tail runs after the next tick's simulation, the
//! HUD text helpers are called from a dozen render paths, and the loading strip
//! is drawn from inside map streaming. Threading `&mut Gpu` through every one
//! of those signatures would add a pointer argument to each render call for a
//! zero-sized handle, so the token lives here instead and callers borrow it
//! for the length of one call.
//!
//! The rule that keeps that sound is the one the borrow checker enforces
//! elsewhere: never hold the reference across a call that borrows it again, and
//! never draw immediately while a linked-list walk is running (callers fence
//! the walk with [`psx_gpu::chain::wait`] first, as they did before).
